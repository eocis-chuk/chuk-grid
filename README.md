# prototype-grid

Code to define a prototype 100m CHUK grid on EPSG:27700

Prototype grids will be replaced with an official version (expected later in 2023)

## installation

Requires packages xarray, pyproj and netcdf4.  Tested with Python 3.10

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## running

```
# generate grid at 10km resolution

python src/create_protoype_grid.py output.nc --resolution 10000
```

## todo

* tested at 1000m, check that a 100m resolution grid can be generated by running on JASMIN
