# chuk-grid

Code to construct a (at 100m and other resolutions) CHUK grid on EPSG:27700 and export it to NetCDF4

## installation

Requires packages xarray, pyproj and netcdf4.  

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pyproj_env
pip install -e .
```

## running

```
# generate grid at 1km resolution

create_chuk_grid output.nc --resolution 1000
```

## todo

* ~~tested at 1000m, check that a 100m resolution grid can be generated by running on JASMIN~~
